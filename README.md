Example-Project
---------------
For Solve the Labyrinth:

I use LeftHand Algoritmus and in addition I record all the steps. The LeftHandAlgoritmus 
have a weak spot. In a circle he finds no solution. I can handle that in which one
records all the steps and compares and so can take the way you not yet gone.
